## Setup for local development

Open two terminal windows, one for the front-end and one for the back-end.

`cd` into the client directory and run `npm start`

next, switch to the server directory with `cd ../server` and run `npm run dev`



### front-end:
open up the browser and visit this [url](http://localhost:3001) 

right click to inspect and open up the console


### back-end:
feel free to use the browser for GET requests. it can be helpful to download a 
JSON formatting browser extension. Microsoft Edge has a built in 'Network Console'
tab that lets you send POST requests as well.

the REST Client extension lets you run the files in the requests directory. it is a 
pretty useful extension to use while developing.
